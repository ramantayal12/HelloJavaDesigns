# java concurrency

- definition : multiple things happening at same time 
- threads : code blocks that can be executed in separate paths.
- threads can be used to improve the responsiveness of programs in java 
- process vs thread 
  - process : instance of a running program 
    - isolated 
      - private memory space
      - data is not shared
  - thread : semi-process or subprocess
    - executes a given piece of code 
    - can run concurrently with other threads
    - share data and memory 
  - example : 
    - process : product search 
    - threads : a. query database b. manage user interface
- multithreading : switching between threads 
  - better cpu and i/o utilisation 
  - long tasks can run in a thread 
- main thread : special thread created by JVM
- Thread.class encapsulated the attributes and behaviour of Java thread.
  - Thread.class has a static method named currentThread
  - this method returns reference to the current running thread.
- threads run in parallel with the main thread
- Daemon vs Non-Daemon Threads 
  - Daemon 
    - infrastructure thread
    - runs in background 
    - garbage collection
  - Non-Daemon 
    - non-infra structure thread
    - performs program tasks 
    - main Thread is also a non daemon thread
  - JVM treats differently daemon and non daemon threads 
    - daemon threads have low priority than non-daemon threads
    - JVM waits to stop itself before all non-daemon threads to finish
    - JVM terminates the daemon threads 
- any newly created thread inherits its status of daemon/no-daemon from its parent thread

- Java Thread is an object like any other Java object.
  - Thread represents a separate path of execution 
  - running behaviour of thread is represented by Runnable interface
- An instance of the Thread class or its sub class represents a separate path of execution. The Runnable interface represents the running behaviour of a thread.
- thread communication 
  - join() method 
    - blocking method
