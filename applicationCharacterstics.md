# application characteristics 

## latency 
- round trip time
- network delay + computational delay 

- impact of architecture patterns on latency
  - monolithic vs distributed systems
  - monolithic
    - method to method call
    - single machine
    - typically monolithic systems have no network delay 
  - distributed systems 
    - network to network call
    - extra network delay
